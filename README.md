# KaggleTitanic
The Kaggle Titanic competition asks you to predict whether a passenger will survive or not based on a variety of explanatory variables, including sex, fare, etc. For the competition, I will practice using a variety of machine learning algorithms and then submit my result to Kaggle. Specifically, I plan on using

0. Null Model
1. kNN
2. Boosted C5.0 
3. Random Forest
4. Logistic Regression using regularization
